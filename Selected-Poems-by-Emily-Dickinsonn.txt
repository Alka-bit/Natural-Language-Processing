Selected Poems by Emily Dickinson

216

Safe in their Alabaster Chambers —
Untouched by Morning

And untouched by Noon —

Sleep the meek members of the Resurrection —
Rafter of satin,

And Roof of stone.

Light laughs the breeze

In her Castle above them —

Babbles the Bee in a stolid Ear,

Pipe the Sweet Birds in ignorant cadence —
Ah, what sagacity perished here!

258

There’s a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons —

That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes —

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us —
We can find no scar,

But internal difference,
Where the Meanings, are —

None may teach it — Any —
“Tis the Seal Despair —

An imperial affliction
Sent us of the Air —

When it comes, the Landscape listens —
Shadows — hold their breath —

When it goes, ‘tis like the Distance

On the look of Death —
303

The Soul selects her own Society —
Then — shuts the Door —

To her divine Majority —

Present no more —

Unmoved — she notes the Chariots — pausing —
At her low Gate —

Unmoved — an Emperor be kneeling

Upon her Mat —

I've known her — from an ample nation —
Choose One —

Then — close the Valves of her attention —
Like Stone —

328

A Bird came down the Walk —
He did not know I saw —

He bit an Angleworm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw,

And then he drank a Dew

From a convenient Grass —

And then hopped sidewise to the Wall
To let a Beetle pass —

He glanced with rapid eyes

That hurried all around —

They looked like frightened Beads, I thought —
He stirred his Velvet Head

Like one in danger, Cautious,

I offered him a Crumb

And he unrolled his feathers

And rowed him softer home —
Than Oars divide the Ocean,

Too silver for a seam —

Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon
Leap, plashless as they swim.
341

After great pain, a formal feeling comes —
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs —
The stiff Heart questions was it He, that bore,
And Yesterday, or Centuries before?

The Feet, mechanical, go round —
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought —

A Wooden way

Regardless grown,

A Quartz contentment, like a stone —

This is the Hour of Lead —

Remembered, if outlived,

As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow —

First — Chill — then Stupor — then the letting go —

449

I died for Beauty — but was scarce
Adjusted in the Tomb

When One who died for Truth, was lain
In an adjoining room —

He questioned softly “Why I failed?”

“For Beauty,” I replied —

“And I — for Truth — Themself are One —
We Brethren, are,” He said —

And so, as Kinsmen, met a Night —
We talked between the Rooms —
Until the Moss had reached our lips —
And covered up — our names —
465

I heard a Fly buzz — when I died —
The Stillness in the Room

Was like the Stillness in the Air —
Between the Heaves of Storm —

The Eyes around — had wrung them dry —
And Breaths were gathering firm

For that last Onset — when the King

Be witnessed — in the Room —

I willed my Keepsakes — Signed away
What portion of me be

Assignable — and then it was

There interposed a Fly —

With Blue — uncertain stumbling Buzz —
Between the light — and me —

And then the Windows failed — and then
I could not see to see—

585

I like to see it lap the Miles —
And lick the Valleys up —

And stop to feed itself at Tanks —
And then — prodigious step

Around a Pile of Mountains —

And supercilious peer

In Shanties — by the sides of Roads —
And then a Quarry pare

To fit its Ribs

And crawl between
Complaining all the while

In horrid — hooting stanza —
Then chase itself down Hill —

And neigh like Boanerges —
Then — punctual as a Star
Stop — docile and omnipotent
At its own stable door —
657

I dwell in Possibility —

A fairer House than Prose —
More numerous of Windows —
Superior — for Doors —

Of Chambers as the Cedars —
Impregnable of Eye —

And for an Everlasting Roof
The Gambrels of the Sky —

Of Visitors — the fairest —

For Occupation — This —

The spreading wide my narrow Hands
To gather Paradise —

712

Because I could not stop for Death—
He kindly stopped for me—

The Carriage held but just Ourselves—
And Immortality.

We slowly drove—He knew no haste,
And I had put away

My labor and my leisure too,

For His Civility—

We passed the School, where Children strove
At recess—in the ring—

We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain—

We passed the Setting Sun—

Or rather—He passed Us—

The Dews drew quivering and chill—
For only Gossamer, my Gown—

My Tippet—only Tulle—

We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground—

The Roof was scarcely visible—

The Cornice—in the Ground—
Since then—'tis centuries— and yet
Feels shorter than the Day

I first surmised the Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity—

1129

Tell all the Truth but tell it slant —
Success in Circuit lies

Too bright for our infirm Delight
The Truth's superb surprise

As Lightning to the Children eased
With explanation kind

The Truth must dazzle gradually
Or every man be blind —
