# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence, it is concerned with the interactions between machines and natural language 

NLP is concerned with the ability of machines to analyze, understand and process natural language, hence deriving meaning to it. NLP involves following tasks 

>> Summarization
>> Translation 
>> Entity Recognition 
>> Relationship Extraction 
>> Sentiment Analysis
>> Speech Recognition
>> Topic Segmentation 

Natural Language Processing is characterized as a difficult problem; human language/natural language is rarely precise. Hence to understand natural language is to understand not only the words, but the concepts and how they're linked together to create meaning. Despite language being one of the easiest things for the human mind to learn, the ambiguity of language is what makes the NLP a difficult problem to master.

NLP combines computational linguistics-rule-based modeling of natural language -- with statistical, machine learning and deep learning models. These models enable machines to process natural language in the form of text or voice data and to 'Understand' its meaning, complete with the speaker or writer's intent and sentiment.
