# Natural Language Processing

*This course starts with the basics of text processing including basic pre-processing, spelling correction, language modeling, Part-of-Speech tagging, Constituency and Dependency Parsing, Lexical Semantics, distributional Semantics and topic models. Finally, the course also covers some of the most interesting applications of text mining such as entity linking, relation extraction, text summarization, text classification, sentiment analysis and opinion mining.*

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence, it is concerned with the interactions between machines and natural language 

It is characterized as a difficult problem; human language/natural language is rarely precise. Hence to understand natural language is to understand not only the words, but the concepts and how they're linked together to create meaning. Despite language being one of the easiest things for the human mind to learn, the ambiguity of language is what makes the NLP a difficult problem to master.
